A mobile app, short for "mobile application," is a software program designed to run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is typically downloaded and installed from an app store or marketplace specific to the device's operating system, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
Mobile apps offer various functionalities and services to users, ranging from games and entertainment to productivity tools, social networking platforms, e-commerce platforms, and much more. They are developed using programming languages and frameworks that are compatible with mobile operating systems like iOS (for Apple devices) or Android (for most other devices).
Mobile apps take advantage of the features and capabilities of mobile devices, such as touchscreens, cameras, GPS, accelerometers, and other sensors. They are designed to provide a user-friendly and optimized experience for mobile users, allowing them to access information, perform tasks, and engage with digital services conveniently from their devices.
